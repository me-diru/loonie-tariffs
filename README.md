# 🇨🇦 Buy Canadian & Non-US Alternatives

**A crowd-sourced guide to help Canadians find local and non-US alternatives in response to tariffs.**

## 📌 Why This Exists
The United States has imposed tariffs that affect Canadian consumers and businesses. This repository is a collaborative effort to:
- Promote Canadian-made goods.
- Highlight non-US alternatives (Asian, European, etc.).
- Support local businesses and reduce dependency on US imports.
- Ensure that, ideally, products have no US company involvement.
